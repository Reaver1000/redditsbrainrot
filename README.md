# redditsbrainrot
scrape reddit posts and generate brainrot videos. with emphasis on NO docker, NO paid apis and NO complex or tricky module instals

I have made this extremely modular, I want each building block working before i wrap it up in a pretty package.  
There is NO tts hooked up at the moment, you will need to manually do free trial versions, program your own, or wait until i get to that part. 

Still to do 
Working model! 
Find a TSS that meets my criteria of free or good enough while being easy to install. Made it modular, can just be a standalone or api fed column B and C and save to the rows filename in voiceovers folder
make a functional main that allows step by step choices in gui, or automates when run and left alone so it can be run on a timer ) 
move the current local CSV online so automatic posting is possible ( n8n, make, postiz etc )
